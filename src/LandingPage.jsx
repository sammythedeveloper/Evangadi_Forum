            Step 1: Clearly understand WHY you have to learn a technology field

          <p className=" text-xs ">
            If you are reading this, we understand you are already interested to
            learn a technology field. But, we have repeatedly noticed that this
            decision is made based on wrong assumptions. For example, some
            people assume it is an easy shortcut to get a well paying job with
            in 3 months. IT IS NOT!! Please start by watching this video to
            clearly understand WHY you have to learn a technology field.

          Step 2: Carefully choose the right field to learn Once you clearly
          understand WHY you have to learn a tech field, you have to carefully
          choose a field to study first. As an outsider trying to get into the
          tech world, you probably have heard multiple suggestions such as SQL,
          AWS, Web Development, MuleSoft, SharePoint, QA or many other fields.
          Please watch this video to understand which one is right for you.
